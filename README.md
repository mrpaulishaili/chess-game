# #31DaysofCoding of building my current favorite game, Chess

## ⅅ𝔸𝕐 𝕋𝕎𝕆 - Setting up the Project Environment with Vite and PNPM

Today, we'll embark on the task of setting up our project environment using Vite and PNPM for developing our chess game.

🔧 Vite: We choose Vite, a fast and efficient development build tool, to power our project environment. Vite leverages native ES modules and builds on-demand, providing quick and snappy development feedback. Its streamlined development experience makes it an excellent choice for building modern web applications like our chess game.

⚙️ PNPM: For efficient package management, we'll be using PNPM. PNPM offers performance optimizations and reduced disk space usage through its unique "hoisting" mechanism. With strict versioning and deterministic installs, PNPM ensures consistent builds across environments, making it a reliable companion for managing our project dependencies.

To set up our environment:

1️⃣ Install PNPM: If you haven't already, install PNPM globally on your machine by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g pnpm

2️⃣ Create the Project: Let's create a new project using Vite. In your desired location, execute the following command:

pnpx create-vite chess-game --template react-ts

3️⃣ Navigate to the Project: Move into the "chess-game" folder using the command:

cd chess-game

4️⃣ Install Dependencies: Install the project dependencies using PNPM by running the command:

pnpm install

This will fetch and install all the necessary packages for our chess game project.

5️⃣ Verify Setup: To ensure everything is working correctly, start the development server with the command:

pnpm dev

You should see a message indicating that the server is running and that you can access your project at the provided URL.

With our project environment set up using Vite and PNPM, we're ready to dive in and continue on the #31DaysofCoding journey.

> Stay tuned for the next update as we delve deeper into implementation details and make progress in our chess game development!
